# Email Task Extractor

An AI-powered tool that extracts structured tasks from unstructured emails using Large Language Models (LLMs). The system automatically assigns confidence scores and routes low-confidence tasks to human review.

## 🌐 Live Demo

**Try it here:** [https://email-task-extractor.streamlit.app/](https://email-task-extractor.streamlit.app/)

> **Note:** The live demo has limited API access to prevent usage costs. To use the full AI extraction features, clone this repo and run it locally with your own Anthropic API key (see [Quick Start](#quick-start) below). The demo showcases the UI and functionality.

## Features

- 🤖 **AI-Powered Extraction**: Uses Claude to extract tasks, deadlines, assignees, and priorities from email text
- 📊 **Confidence Scoring**: Dual-layer confidence system (LLM + rule-based adjustments)
- 🔀 **Automatic Routing**: Auto-approves high-confidence tasks, flags uncertain ones for review
- 📋 **Structured Output**: Converts messy emails into clean, actionable task lists
- 💡 **Interactive CLI**: Easy-to-use command-line interface
- 🌐 **Web Interface**: Beautiful Streamlit app for non-technical users

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher (already installed ✅)
- Anthropic API key (get one at https://console.anthropic.com/)

## Quick Start

> **Want the full AI extraction?** Clone this repo and run locally with your own API key. The [live demo](https://email-task-extractor.streamlit.app/) has limited API access to prevent usage costs.

### 🌐 Option A: Web Application (RECOMMENDED)

**Best for:** Hackathons, work demos, sharing with non-technical users

#### Setup (2 minutes):

1. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Configure API key:**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-your-key-here
```

3. **Launch the web app:**
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

**Or simply double-click:**
- Windows: `run_web_app.bat`
- Mac/Linux: `run_web_app.sh`

The app opens at `http://localhost:8501` with a beautiful interface!

**Web App Features:**
- ✨ Professional, user-friendly interface
- 📊 Real-time AI extraction with visual feedback
- 🎨 Color-coded confidence scores (green/yellow/red)
- 📤 Export to CSV, JSON, and Markdown
- ⚙️ Adjustable confidence thresholds
- 📈 Processing statistics and history

---

### 🖥️ Option B: Command Line Interface

**Best for:** Developers and technical users

1. **Verify installation:**
```bash
python test_setup.py
```

2. **Run interactive mode:**
```bash
python main.py
```

3. **Use as library:**
3. **Use as library:**
```python
from task_extractor import process_email

result = process_email("Your email text here...")
for task in result['processed_tasks']:
    print(f"Task: {task['task_description']}")
```

## Screenshots

### Web Application
The web app provides an intuitive interface where users can:
- Paste emails or upload files
- See real-time extraction with confidence scores
- Edit and export tasks
- Track processing history

### Confidence Score System

**LLM Confidence (0.0 - 1.0)**:
- 0.8-1.0: Explicitly stated, very clear
- 0.5-0.7: Clear task but some ambiguity
- 0.0-0.5: Vague or highly uncertain

**Rule-Based Adjustments**:
- Missing deadline: -0.15
- Unspecified assignee: -0.20
- Vague language: -0.10

### 3. Automatic Routing

Based on final confidence scores:

| Confidence | Status | Action |
|------------|--------|--------|
| ≥ 0.7 | ✅ Auto-approved | Ready to add to task system |
| 0.5 - 0.7 | ⚠️ Needs review | Standard review queue |
| < 0.5 | 🔴 Urgent review | High-priority review queue |

## Example Usage

### Sample Email
```
Subject: Q1 Deliverables

Hi team,

Sarah - Please finalize the marketing report by March 20th. 
This is critical.

The engineering team should review the API docs sometime 
before end of quarter.

Thanks!
```

### Extracted Output
```json
{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "task_description": "Finalize the marketing report",
      "assignee": "Sarah",
      "deadline": "2024-03-20",
      "priority": "high",
      "confidence_score": 0.95,
      "review_status": "auto_approved"
    },
    {
      "task_description": "Review API documentation",
      "assignee": "engineering team",
      "deadline": null,
      "priority": "medium",
      "confidence_score": 0.58,
      "review_status": "needs_review"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Customization

### Adjust Confidence Thresholds

Edit `task_extractor.py`:
```python
queue = TaskReviewQueue(
    auto_approve_threshold=0.8,  # Raise for stricter auto-approval
    high_priority_threshold=0.6   # Adjust review urgency threshold
)
```

### Modify Rule-Based Penalties

Edit the `calculate_final_confidence` method in `task_extractor.py`:
```python
if not task.get('deadline'):
    penalties += 0.15  # Adjust this value
```

### Change LLM Model

Edit the model in `task_extractor.py`:
```python
model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514"  # or claude-opus-4-20250514 for more accuracy
```

## Confidence Scoring Guidelines

The system assigns confidence based on:

✅ **High Confidence (0.8-1.0)**
- Explicit task statement
- Clear deadline with specific date
- Named assignee
- Unambiguous language

⚠️ **Medium Confidence (0.5-0.7)**
- Clear task but vague deadline ("next week", "soon")
- Assignee is a team/group not individual
- Some contextual inference needed

🔴 **Low Confidence (0.0-0.5)**
- Vague task description
- No deadline mentioned
- No assignee specified
- Conditional language ("might", "maybe")

## Troubleshooting

### "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not found" error
- Make sure you created a `.env` file (not `.env.example`)
- Check that your API key is correctly pasted
- Ensure there are no extra spaces or quotes around the key

### Import errors
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
```

### JSON parsing errors
- The LLM occasionally returns invalid JSON
- The system catches this and returns an error response
- Try running again or adjust the prompt temperature

## Next Steps

To integrate this into a production system:

1. **Email Integration**: Connect to Gmail API, IMAP, or email webhooks
2. **Database**: Store extracted tasks in PostgreSQL/MongoDB
3. **Review Interface**: Build a web UI for human reviewers
4. **Task System Integration**: Push auto-approved tasks to Asana/Jira/etc.
5. **Monitoring**: Track confidence score accuracy and false positive/negative rates
6. **Feedback Loop**: Store human corrections to improve prompts over time

## API Usage Costs

Approximate costs (as of Feb 2025):
- Claude Sonnet 4: ~$0.003 per email (varies by length)
- Processing 1000 emails: ~$3
