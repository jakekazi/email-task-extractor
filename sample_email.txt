Subject: Urgent: Product Launch Tasks

Hi Team,

We have the product launch coming up and need to get several things done ASAP.

1. Sarah, please complete the final review of the marketing materials by Friday, March 15th. This is our top priority.

2. The development team needs to deploy the new features to production. John mentioned he'd handle this, but we haven't set a specific date yet.

3. Can someone schedule a launch readiness meeting? Probably should happen before the 20th.

4. We should probably think about updating the documentation, but I'm not sure who has capacity for this right now.

5. Lisa - critical: The client presentation deck must be ready by March 18th for the investor meeting.

Also, sometime next month we might want to do a team retrospective.

Let me know if anyone has conflicts or concerns.

Thanks,
Alex
Product Manager
